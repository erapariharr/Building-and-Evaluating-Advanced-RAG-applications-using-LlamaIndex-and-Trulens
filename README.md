# Building-and-Evaluating-Advanced-RAG-applications-using-LlamaIndex-and-Trulens

- Improved the RAG pipeline using advanced retrieval techniques such as sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval.
- Adopted evaluation best practices, focusing on Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance to ensure robust and reliable outputs.
- Working on a Streamlit app to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the advanced RAG applications.
- Utilized Streamlit components to visualize the agentâ€™s reasoning process with trace logs, dependency graphs, and interactive elements.
- I plan to delpy the app by installing Streamlit, creating and testing the app locally, and using cloud platforms like Streamlit Sharing for broader accessibility.
